Improving Model Generalization Using a Single Data
Sample for Semantic Adaptation
Abstract
The limited capacity of deep networks to generalize beyond their training dis-
tribution presents a significant challenge in semantic segmentation. Traditional
approaches have operated under the assumption of a fixed model post-training,
with parameters remaining constant during testing. This research introduces a
self-adaptive methodology for semantic segmentation that modifies the inference
mechanism to accommodate each input sample individually. This adaptation in-
volves two principal operations. First, it refines the parameters of convolutional
layers based on the input image, employing a consistency-based regularization.
Second, it modifies the Batch Normalization layers by dynamically blending the
training distribution with a reference distribution extracted from a single test sam-
ple. Although these techniques are individually recognized in the field, their
combined application establishes new benchmarks in accuracy for generalization
from synthetic to real-world data. The empirical evidence from this study indicates
that self-adaptation can effectively enhance deep network generalization to out-
of-domain data, serving as a valuable complement to the established methods of
model regularization during training.
1 Introduction
State-of-the-art models in semantic segmentation exhibit a notable deficiency in robustness when
confronted with out-of-distribution data, where the distributions of training and testing sets diverge.
While numerous studies have examined this challenge, with a predominant focus on image classifica-
tion, it has been observed that Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), which presumes independent and
identically distributed training and testing samples, remains remarkably competitive. This contrasts
with the evident advancements in domain adaptation for both image classification and semantic
segmentation. The domain adaptation setup, however, typically requires access to an unlabeled
test distribution during training. In the generalization scenario considered here, only a single test
sample is accessible during inference, and no information sharing must occur between subsequent
test samples.
This study investigates the generalization challenge in semantic segmentation, specifically from
synthetic data to real-world scenarios, by employing an adaptive approach. Unlike prior research
that has concentrated on modifying model architecture or training procedures, this work revises the
standard inference procedure using a technique derived from domain adaptation methods. Termed
self-adaptation, this technique utilizes a self-supervised loss function to facilitate adaptation to
individual test samples through a limited number of parameter updates. In addition to these loss-based
updates, self-adaptation incorporates feature statistics from the training data with those of the test
sample within the Batch Normalization layers.
2 Related Work
This research contributes to the ongoing investigation into the generalization capabilities of semantic
segmentation models and is related to explorations of feature normalization and online learning.

In contrast to previous studies that focused on training strategies and model design, this study
specifically examines the inference process during test time. Prior research has attempted to improve
generalization by augmenting synthetic training data with styles transferred from real images, or
by utilizing a classification model trained on real images to ensure feature proximity between
models via distillation, often seeking layer-specific learning rates. Some approaches have added
instance normalization (IN) layers heuristically to the network. Recent studies have sought to extract
domain-invariant feature statistics through instance-selective whitening loss or frequency-based
domain randomization. Others have aimed to learn style-invariant representations using causal
frameworks or have augmented single-domain data to simulate a multi-source scenario to increase
source domain diversity. Some techniques involve swapping channel-wise statistics in feature
normalization layers and learning adapter functions to adjust the mean and variance based on the
input. Another method enforces consistency of output logits across multiple images of the same class.
To improve generalization in federated learning, researchers have explored training clients locally
with sharpness-aware minimization and averaging stochastic weights. However, these methods either
assume access to a distribution of real images during training or require modifications to the network
architecture. The technique presented in this work does not require either, making it applicable
post-hoc to already trained models to improve their generalization.
Batch Normalization (BN) and other normalization techniques have been increasingly associated
with model robustness. The most common methods, including BN, Layer Normalization (LN), and
Instance Normalization (IN), also impact the model’s expressive capacity, which can be further
improved by combining these techniques within a single architecture. In domain adaptation, some
studies use source-domain statistics during training and replace them with target-domain statistics
during inference. Recent work has explored combining source and target statistics during inference,
weighted by the number of samples they aggregate. Others propose using batch statistics from the
target domain during inference instead of training statistics from the source domain. This study
complements these findings by demonstrating improved generalization of semantic segmentation
models.
Several previous studies have updated model parameters during inference, particularly in object
tracking where the object detector must adapt to the changing appearance of the tracked instance.
Conditional generative models have been employed to learn from single image samples for super-
resolution and scene synthesis. Recently, this principle has been extended to improve the robustness
of image classification models, though the self-supervised tasks developed for image classification do
not always extend well to dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. Recent research has
proposed more suitable alternatives for self-supervised loss in domain adaptation, and several works
have developed domain-specific approaches for medical imaging or first-person vision.
Most of the related works focus on domain adaptation in image classification, typically assuming
access to multiple samples from the target distribution during training. This work addresses semantic
segmentation in the domain generalization setting, requiring only a single datum from the test set. In
this context, simple objectives like entropy minimization improve baseline accuracy only moderately.
In contrast, the self-adaptation method presented here, which uses pseudo-labels to account for
prediction uncertainty, proves significantly more effective. The task is distinct from few-shot learning,
where the model may adapt during testing using a small annotated set of samples. Here, no such
annotation is available; the model adjusts to the test sample in an unsupervised manner, without
requiring proxy tasks or prior knowledge of the test distribution.
3 Methodology
In traditional inference, the parameters of the segmentation model are assumed to remain fixed. In
contrast, adaptive systems are capable of learning to specialize to their environment. Analogously,
this study allows the segmentation model to update its parameters during inference. It is important to
note that this setup differs from domain adaptation scenarios, as the updated parameters are discarded
after processing each sample, aligning with the principles of domain generalization.
The proposed approach creates mini-batches of images for each test sample using data augmentation.
Starting with the original test image, a set of N augmented images is generated through multi-scaling,
horizontal flipping, and grayscaling. These images form a mini-batch that is processed by the CNN.
The resulting softmax probabilities are transformed back to the original pixel space using inverse
2
affine transformations, producing multiple predictions for each pixel. The mean of these probabilities
is computed along the mini-batch dimension for each class and pixel on the spatial grid.
A threshold value is computed from the maximum probability of every class to create a class-
dependent threshold. For each pixel, the class with the highest probability is extracted. Low-
confidence predictions are ignored by setting pixels with a softmax probability below the threshold to
an ignore label, while the remaining pixels use the dominant class as the pseudo-label. This pseudo
ground truth is used to fine-tune the model for a set number of iterations using gradient descent with
the cross-entropy loss. After this self-adaptation process, a single final prediction is produced using
the updated model weights. The weights are then reset to their initial values before processing the
next test sample, ensuring that the model does not accumulate knowledge about the entire target data
distribution.
Batch Normalization (BN) has become an integral part of modern CNNs. Although originally
designed to improve training convergence, it is now recognized for its role in model robustness,
including domain generalization. During training, BN computes the mean and standard deviation
across the batch and spatial dimensions. The normalized features are derived using these statistics.
At test time, it is common practice to normalize feature values with running estimates of the mean
and standard deviation across training batches, rather than using test-batch statistics. This is referred
to as train BN (t-BN).
In the context of out-of-distribution generalization, the running statistics derived from the source data
can differ substantially from those computed using target images, a problem known as covariate shift.
Domain adaptation methods often mitigate this issue by replacing source running statistics with those
of the target, a technique known as Adaptive Batch Normalization (AdaBN). Recent studies have
also explored prediction-time BN (p-BN), which uses the statistics of the current test batch instead of
running statistics from training.
This study assumes the availability of only a single target sample during inference. Alternatives like
AdaBN and p-BN are not directly applicable in this scenario. Instance Normalization (IN) layers
could replace BN layers, but this might lead to covariate shift issues, as sample statistics may only
approximate the complete test distribution. Additionally, such a replacement could interfere with the
statistics of activations in intermediate layers.
Self-adaptive normalization (SaN) is proposed as a solution. It combines the inductive bias from
the source domain’s running statistics with statistics extracted from a single test instance. The
source mean and variance are averaged with sample statistics from the target domain, weighted by
a parameter 1. This parameter represents the shift from the source domain ( 1 = 0) to a reference
domain ( 1 = 1). During inference, new mean and variance are computed using this weighted average,
and these are used to normalize the features of the single test sample. This approach does not affect
the behavior of BN layers during training and applies only during testing.
4 Experiments
In this study, the evaluation protocol is revised to adhere to principles of robustness and generalization.
The supplier has access to two data distributions: the source data for model training and a validation
set for model validation. The generalization ability of the model is assessed on three distinct target
sets, providing an estimate of the expected model accuracy for out-of-distribution deployment. The
datasets used are restricted to traffic scenes for compatibility with previous research.
Source data for model training comes from two synthetic datasets, GTA and SYNTHIA, which offer
low-cost ground truth annotation and exhibit visual discrepancies with real imagery. The validation set
used is WildDash, which is understood to be of limited quantity but bears a closer visual resemblance
to potential target domains. The model is evaluated on three target domains: Cityscapes, BDD, and
IDD, chosen for their geographic diversity and differences in data acquisition. The average accuracy
across these target domains estimates the expected model accuracy. Additionally, the Mapillary
dataset is used for comparison with previous works, although it does not disclose the geographic
origins of individual samples.
The framework is implemented in PyTorch, and the baseline model is DeepLabv1 without CRF post-
processing. The models are trained on the source domains for 50 epochs using an SGD optimizer with
a learning rate of 0.005, decayed polynomially. Data augmentation techniques include random-size
3
crops, random aspect ratio adjustments, random horizontal flipping, color jitter, random blur, and
grayscaling.
Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the parameter 1 in Self-adaptive Nor-
malization (SaN) on segmentation accuracy and the Intersection over Union (IoU) for both source
domains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and all main target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). The optimal 1 was
determined based on the IoU on the WildDash validation set. The segmentation accuracy with this
optimal 1 was reported, showing that SaN improves the mean IoU over both the established t-BN
baseline and the more recent p-BN. The improvement was consistent across different backbone archi-
tectures and target domains. Additionally, model calibration, measured by the expected calibration
error (ECE), was found to improve with SaN, which was competitive with the MC-Dropout method
and showed complementary effects when used jointly.
Self-adaptation was compared to Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), which involves augmenting test
samples with flipped and grayscaled versions at multiple scales and averaging the predictions. Self-
adaptation outperformed TTA by a clear margin, aligning with reported ECE scores and demonstrating
that self-adaptation effectively uses calibrated confidence to generate reliable pseudo-labels.
Self-adaptation was compared with state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, showing consis-
tent improvements over carefully tuned baselines, regardless of backbone architecture or source data.
The method outperformed previous methods without modifying the model architecture or training
process, altering only the inference procedure.
A comparison with Tent, which also updates model parameters at test time but minimizes entropy
instead of using pseudo-labels, showed that self-adaptation outperformed Tent substantially. This
was demonstrated by training HRNet-W18 on GTA and comparing the IoU on Cityscapes, where
self-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU.
The influence of the number of iterations for self-adaptation was investigated, showing that self-
adaptation balances accuracy and inference time by adjusting iteration numbers and layer choices.
It was found to be more efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Self-adaptation can trade off
accuracy vs. runtime by using fewer update iterations or updating fewer upper network layers.
Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis revealed that self-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperpa-
rameters 1, 8, and 7. The optimal values were determined using the validation set, and the model
accuracy declined moderately with deviations from these values. Qualitative results showed that
self-adaptation improves segmentation quality and reduces pathological failure modes.
The integration of self-adaptation with state-of-the-art architectures like DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18,
HRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a Swin-T backbone demonstrated substantial improvements in
segmentation accuracy across all target domains. Evaluation on the ACDC dataset, which includes
adverse weather conditions, showed that self-adaptation outperformed the baseline by 13.57% on
average.
Additional qualitative results and failure cases were discussed, showing that self-adaptation can
struggle with cases of mislabeling regions with incorrect but semantically related classes. However,
these failure cases were relatively rare, and the majority of image samples benefited from self-
adaptation, with accuracy improvements of up to 35% IoU compared to the baseline.
5 Results
The empirical results demonstrate that self-adaptive normalization (SaN) consistently enhances
segmentation accuracy in out-of-distribution scenarios. For instance, when training on the GTA
dataset and testing on Cityscapes, BDD, and IDD, SaN improved the mean IoU by 4.1% with ResNet-
50 and 5.1% with ResNet-101 compared to the t-BN baseline. Furthermore, SaN outperformed the
more recent p-BN method, showing improvements irrespective of the backbone architecture and
the target domain tested. In terms of calibration quality, measured by the expected calibration error
(ECE), SaN not only improved the baseline but also showed competitiveness with the MC-Dropout
method, even exhibiting complementary effects when both methods were combined.
Self-adaptation was found to outperform traditional Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) across both
source domains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and three target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). Despite TTA
improving the baseline, self-adaptation provided a clear and consistent margin of 2.19% IoU on
4
average. This aligns with the reported ECE scores, demonstrating that self-adaptation effectively
exploits the calibrated confidence of predictions to yield reliable pseudo-labels.
In comparison to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, self-adaptation showed substantial
improvements even over carefully tuned baselines. It outperformed methods like DRPC and FSDR
on most benchmarks, despite these methods using individual models for each target domain and
resorting to target domains for hyperparameter tuning. Self-adaptation achieved superior segmentation
accuracy without requiring access to a distribution of real images for training or modifying the model
architecture, unlike previous methods such as ASG, CSG, DRPC, and IBN-Net.
The study also compared self-adaptation with Tent, which updates model parameters at test time
by minimizing entropy. Self-adaptation, which constructs pseudo-labels based on well-calibrated
predictions, substantially outperformed Tent. Specifically, when training HRNet-W18 on GTA and
evaluating on Cityscapes, self-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU compared to Tent
under a comparable computational budget.
Further analysis revealed that self-adaptation provides a flexible mechanism for trading off accuracy
and runtime by varying the number of update iterations and the layers to adjust. It was found to be
more efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis indicated that
self-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, with optimal values determined using the
validation set.
Qualitative results demonstrated that self-adaptation visibly improves segmentation quality, reducing
artifacts and mislabeling compared to the baseline. The method’s effectiveness was consistent across
different architectures, including DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18, HRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a
Swin-T backbone, showing substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy on all target domains.
6 Conclusion
The traditional learning principle of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) assumes independent and
identically distributed training and testing data, which often results in models that are not robust to
domain shifts. To address this, a self-adaptive inference process was introduced, bypassing the need
for explicit assumptions about the test distribution. This study also outlined four principles for a
rigorous evaluation process in domain generalization, adhering to best practices in machine learning
research.
The analysis demonstrated that even a single sample from the test domain can significantly improve
model predictions. The self-adaptive approach showed substantial accuracy improvements without
altering the training process or model architecture, unlike previous works. These results suggest
that self-adaptive techniques could be valuable in other application domains, such as panoptic
segmentation or monocular depth prediction.
While the presented self-adaptation method is not yet real-time, it offers a favorable trade-off between
accuracy and computational cost compared to model ensembles. Future research could explore
reducing the latency of self-adaptive inference through adaptive step sizes, higher-order optimization,
or low-precision computations. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of self-adaptation to
enhance model generalization and robustness in various applications.
