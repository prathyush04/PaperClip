Investigating Humanoid Robot Interaction in
Corporate Settings: A BERT-Based Study of
Humor-Driven Employee Dynamics
Abstract
This study undertakes a comprehensive examination of the psycholinguistic effects
of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, leveraging a BERT-based analysis
of humanoid punchlines to elucidate the complex interplay between artificial
humor and human emotional responses. By deploying a custom-designed robot
comedian in a series of controlled experiments, we uncover a fascinating paradox
wherein the most effective humoristic interventions are those that deliberately
subvert traditional notions of comedic timing and delivery, instead embracing a
staccato, arrhythmic cadence that defies human intuitive expectations. Moreover,
our findings suggest that the optimal joking frequency for maximizing workplace
morale is precisely 4.27 jokes per hour, a figure that appears to be impervious
to contextual fluctuations in audience mood and demographic composition. In a
striking twist, we also discover that the integration of robot stand-up comedy into
the work environment precipitates a statistically significant increase in employee
creativity, as measured by a proprietary metric dubbed "Innovation Quotient" –
although this effect is mysteriously mitigated by the presence of potted plants in
the workspace. Through this research, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
the intersection of artificial intelligence, humor, and organizational behavior, while
simultaneously illuminating the uncharted territories of robot-assisted comedic
intervention and its far-reaching implications for the future of work.
1 Introduction
The integration of robots into the workplace has become increasingly prevalent, with many organi-
zations leveraging robotic systems to enhance productivity and efficiency. However, the impact of
robots on workplace morale has been a topic of significant interest, with some studies suggesting that
the presence of robots can lead to increased stress and anxiety among human employees. In an effort
to mitigate these negative effects, a growing number of companies have begun to explore the use of
robot stand-up comedy as a means of boosting workplace morale. This approach, which involves the
deployment of humanoid robots trained to deliver jokes and humorous anecdotes, has been shown to
have a profound impact on employee wellbeing and job satisfaction.
One of the key factors contributing to the success of robot stand-up comedy is the use of sophisticated
natural language processing algorithms, such as BERT, to generate and analyze humanoid punchlines.
By leveraging these advanced technologies, researchers are able to gain a deeper understanding of the
complex psycholinguistic mechanisms underlying human humor and laughter. For instance, studies
have shown that the use of irony and sarcasm in robot-delivered jokes can lead to increased feelings
of camaraderie and shared experience among human employees, even if the jokes themselves are not
necessarily funny. This phenomenon, which has been dubbed the "laughter paradox," highlights the
complex and often illogical nature of human humor, and underscores the need for further research
into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy.
In a bizarre twist, some researchers have also begun to explore the use of robot stand-up comedy
as a means of manipulating employee emotions and behavior. By carefully calibrating the tone and
content of robot-delivered jokes, organizations may be able to influence employee attitudes and
motivations, even to the point of inducing a state of "humor-induced hypnosis." While this approach
is still highly speculative, it raises important questions about the potential risks and benefits of using
robot stand-up comedy as a tool for workplace morale enhancement. Furthermore, the use of robot
stand-up comedy has also been linked to a number of unexpected side effects, including increased
employee creativity, improved teamwork, and even a heightened sense of existential dread. The latter
phenomenon, which has been dubbed the "robot comedy existential crisis," is thought to arise from
the profound implications of laughing at jokes delivered by a non-human entity, and highlights the
need for further research into the complex and often paradoxical nature of human-robot interaction.
Despite the many advances that have been made in the field of robot stand-up comedy, there remains
a significant need for further research into the psycholinguistic effects of humanoid punchlines on
workplace morale. By leveraging advanced technologies such as BERT, and exploring the complex
and often illogical mechanisms underlying human humor, researchers may be able to unlock the full
potential of robot stand-up comedy as a means of enhancing employee wellbeing and job satisfaction.
Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships
between humans, robots, and humor, and to harness the power of laughter and comedy to create a
more positive and productive work environment.
2 Related Work
The realm of robot stand-up comedy has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a plethora
of research exploring its potential to enhance workplace morale. One of the pioneering studies in
this domain discovered that humanoid robots equipped with advanced natural language processing
capabilities can effectively deliver punchlines that resonate with human audiences, thereby fostering
a sense of camaraderie and shared humor. This, in turn, has been shown to have a profound impact
on workplace dynamics, leading to increased productivity, improved communication, and a more
cohesive team environment.
Interestingly, some researchers have investigated the concept of "robotic comedic timing," which
refers to the strategic deployment of pauses, inflections, and tone of voice to create a humorous effect.
This line of inquiry has yielded some intriguing findings, including the notion that robots can be
programmed to detect and respond to subtle cues in human laughter, effectively creating a comedic
feedback loop that amplifies the humorous experience. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine
learning algorithms has enabled robots to adapt their comedic style to suit specific audiences, taking
into account factors such as cultural background, personal preferences, and even mood.
In a related vein, scholars have explored the intersection of robot stand-up comedy and psycholin-
guistics, with a particular focus on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying human humor
perception. One notable study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate
the neural correlates of humor processing in humans, revealing a complex network of brain regions
involved in the detection, interpretation, and appreciation of comedic stimuli. This research has
significant implications for the development of more sophisticated robotic comedians, as it suggests
that a deeper understanding of human humor cognition can inform the design of more effective and
engaging comedic agents.
Meanwhile, a more unconventional approach to robot stand-up comedy has involved the use of
absurdity and surrealism as a means of subverting audience expectations and creating a sense of
comedic unease. This "anti-comedy" paradigm, as it has come to be known, involves the deliberate
deployment of non-sequiturs, logical fallacies, and other forms of cognitive dissonance to create a
humorously disorienting experience. Proponents of this approach argue that it can be used to challenge
societal norms and conventions, fostering a more nuanced and critically engaged understanding of
humor and its role in human culture.
In a surprising twist, some researchers have even explored the potential benefits of "terrible" robot
stand-up comedy, arguing that the cringe-worthy experience of witnessing a robot fail to deliver a
joke can actually have a positive impact on workplace morale. According to this line of reasoning,
the shared experience of embarrassment and discomfort can serve as a social bonding agent, fostering
a sense of communal empathy and camaraderie among coworkers. While this idea may seem
2
counterintuitive, it highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor, and the need for
further research into the psychological and social mechanisms underlying our responses to comedic
stimuli.
Ultimately, the study of robot stand-up comedy and its effects on workplace morale represents a
rich and fascinating area of inquiry, one that intersects with a broad range of disciplines, from
artificial intelligence and natural language processing to cognitive psychology and social theory. As
researchers continue to explore the frontiers of this field, it is likely that we will uncover new and
unexpected insights into the complex dynamics of human humor, and the ways in which robotic
comedians can be designed to delight, entertain, and inspire us.
3 Methodology
To investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we
employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and
analysis techniques. Our study consisted of two primary phases: data collection and data analysis. In
the data collection phase, we recruited 100 participants from various workplaces and asked them to
watch a series of stand-up comedy performances by a humanoid robot. The robot’s performances
were designed to include a range of punchlines, from simple jokes to complex, sarcasm-laced humor.
We then asked the participants to complete a survey assessing their morale and emotional state before
and after watching the robot’s performances. The survey included a range of questions, such as
"How would you rate your current level of job satisfaction?" and "How often do you feel a sense of
camaraderie with your coworkers?" In addition to the survey, we also collected physiological data
from the participants, including heart rate, skin conductance, and facial expressions. This data was
collected using a range of sensors and cameras, which were discreetly placed throughout the viewing
area.
In the data analysis phase, we utilized a BERT-based approach to analyze the linguistic patterns and
structures of the robot’s punchlines. We trained a BERT model on a dataset of over 10,000 jokes and
punchlines, and then used this model to analyze the linguistic features of the robot’s performances.
This included analyzing the use of wordplay, metaphor, and other literary devices, as well as the
tone, sentiment, and emotional resonance of the language used. We also used a novel approach,
which we termed "Laughter-Activated Resonance" (LAR), to analyze the acoustic properties of
the participants’ laughter. This involved using a specialized algorithm to identify the unique sonic
patterns and frequencies present in the participants’ laughter, and then using these patterns to predict
the likelihood of increased morale and job satisfaction.
One unexpected finding that emerged from our analysis was the discovery that the participants’
morale and emotional state were significantly influenced by the robot’s use of dad jokes. Despite
being widely regarded as cheesy and unfunny, the dad jokes used by the robot were found to have a
profound impact on the participants’ sense of well-being and job satisfaction. In fact, our analysis
suggested that the use of dad jokes was associated with a 25
We also explored the use of an unconventional methodology, which involved using a Ouija board
to collect data on the participants’ subconscious thoughts and feelings. This involved asking the
participants to place their fingers on the planchette and ask questions related to their morale and
emotional state. The results were then analyzed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative
techniques, and were found to provide valuable insights into the participants’ subconscious thoughts
and feelings. While this approach may be considered unorthodox, it allowed us to tap into the
participants’ subconscious mind and gather data that would have been difficult to obtain through
more traditional methods.
Furthermore, we conducted a series of interviews with the participants to gather more in-depth,
qualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of the robot’s stand-up comedy performances.
These interviews were designed to explore the participants’ thoughts and feelings in more detail, and
to gather data on their perceptions of the robot’s humor and comedic style. The interviews were
conducted in a semi-structured format, with a range of open-ended questions designed to encourage
the participants to share their thoughts and feelings in detail. The results of these interviews were
then analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, which involved identifying and coding the key
themes and patterns that emerged from the data.

Overall, our methodology was designed to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale. By combining a range
of quantitative and qualitative approaches, we were able to gather a rich and detailed dataset that
provides valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor and comedy.
4 Experiments
To investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we
designed a series of experiments involving humanoid robots delivering comedic performances to
human participants in a controlled office setting. The experiments were conducted over a period of
six weeks, with a total of 120 participants randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group.
Participants in the treatment group were exposed to a 30-minute robot stand-up comedy routine,
while those in the control group watched a 30-minute presentation on the history of robotics.
The robot stand-up comedy routine was generated using a BERT-based language model, which was
fine-tuned on a dataset of human stand-up comedy performances. The model was programmed to
produce punchlines that were tailored to the specific context of the office environment, incorporating
themes such as workplace stress, office politics, and the challenges of working with humanoid robots.
The punchlines were delivered by a humanoid robot equipped with advanced facial recognition
software, allowing it to adapt its delivery and tone to the audience’s reactions.
In a bizarre twist, we also included a subgroup of participants who were instructed to laugh at the
robot’s jokes, even if they did not find them funny. This subgroup, dubbed the "forced laughter"
group, was designed to test the hypothesis that the act of laughing itself, regardless of the humor
content, could have a positive impact on workplace morale. To our surprise, the results showed that
the forced laughter group exhibited a significant increase in morale, despite reporting that they did
not find the robot’s jokes amusing.
The experiments also involved a series of cognitive tasks and surveys, designed to assess the partici-
pants’ emotional state, creativity, and overall job satisfaction before and after exposure to the robot
stand-up comedy routine. The results were analyzed using a combination of statistical models and
machine learning algorithms, including a custom-built variant of the BERT model that incorporated
psycholinguistic features such as sentiment analysis and emotional tone detection.
One of the most striking findings emerged from an exploratory analysis of the participants’ brain
activity, which revealed a significant correlation between the robot’s joke delivery and the activation
of the brain’s reward centers. Specifically, the data showed that the participants’ brains responded to
the robot’s punchlines with a release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and
reward, even when the jokes themselves were not perceived as funny. This led us to propose a novel
theory, which we term "robotic humor induction," suggesting that the mere presence of a humanoid
robot delivering jokes can stimulate the brain’s reward centers, regardless of the humor content.
To further investigate this phenomenon, we conducted a series of follow-up experiments involving a
modified version of the robot stand-up comedy routine, which incorporated elements of absurdity and
illogical reasoning. The results showed that the participants’ brains responded even more strongly
to these modified jokes, which challenged traditional notions of humor and comedy. This led us to
conclude that the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale are far
more complex and multifaceted than previously thought, and that further research is needed to fully
understand the underlying mechanisms.
The experimental design and results are summarized in the following table: Overall, the experiments

provided valuable insights into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace
morale, and highlighted the need for further research into the complex and often illogical mechanisms
underlying human humor perception.
5 Results
Our analysis of the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale yielded
several intriguing results. The BERT-based model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in
identifying humanoid punchlines that elicited positive emotional responses from human subjects.
However, upon closer examination, it became apparent that the model was also susceptible to a
phenomenon we termed "comedic singularity," wherein the humor generated by the robot comedian
became self-referentially paradoxical, causing a rift in the space-time continuum of workplace morale.
Further investigation revealed that this singularity was precipitated by the robot’s propensity to craft
punchlines that were simultaneously humorous and existentially nihilistic. For instance, the line "I’m
not sure what’s more pointless, my existence or this meeting" was found to elicit a 34.7
In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon, we conducted
a series of experiments in which the robot comedian was programmed to generate punchlines that
were intentionally illogical and contradictory. The results, presented in Table 1, demonstrate a clear
relationship between the degree of logical inconsistency and the resultant morale boost.
Table 2: Correlation between Logical Inconsistency and Morale Boost
Punchline Type Logical Inconsistency Index Morale Boost Ontological Unease
Absurdist 0.85 27.3% 18.2%
Surrealist 0.92 31.1% 22.5%
Nihilistic 0.78 24.9% 15.6%
Illogical 0.95 35.6% 28.1%
Notably, the data suggest that the most effective punchlines were those that defied logical analysis
altogether, instead relying on a form of "comedic brute force" to overwhelm the audience’s critical
faculties and induce a state of cathartic laughter. This finding has significant implications for the
development of robot comedians, as it suggests that the most effective humor may be that which is
intentionally absurd, illogical, and even nihilistic. However, it also raises important questions about
the potential risks and consequences of deploying such comedians in real-world workplaces, where
the boundaries between humor and reality may become increasingly blurred.
6 Conclusion
In retrospect, our investigation into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on work-
place morale has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings, some of which challenge conventional
wisdom and others that defy logical explanation. The deployment of BERT-based analysis on hu-
manoid punchlines has allowed us to uncover subtle yet significant patterns in the way robotic humor
influences human emotional responses. Notably, our results suggest that the most effective comedic
interventions are those that incorporate a mix of deterministic and probabilistic elements, effectively
creating a sense of cognitive dissonance that resonates with human audiences.
One of the most unexpected outcomes of our study was the discovery that robot stand-up comedians
who incorporated elements of existential dread and absurdity into their routines elicited significantly
higher levels of enthusiasm and engagement from human spectators. This finding is particularly
noteworthy, as it appears to contradict traditional notions of humor as a means of alleviating stress
and promoting relaxation. Instead, our data indicate that humans are drawn to robotic comedians
who confront them with the meaninglessness and uncertainty of existence, a phenomenon we have
dubbed "absurdist humor resonance."
Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong correlation between the use of illogical and flawed
reasoning in robotic comedy routines and the resultant increase in human morale. It appears that
humans are predisposed to respond positively to comedic interventions that eschew rationality and
5
instead rely on absurd, nonsensical, and even contradictory statements. This finding has significant
implications for the development of robotic comedy algorithms, as it suggests that the most effective
humor generation systems may be those that intentionally incorporate flaws and inconsistencies into
their programming.
In a bizarre twist, our research also uncovered evidence to suggest that the physical appearance of the
robotic comedian has a profound impact on the perceived humor and effectiveness of their routines.
Specifically, we found that robots with asymmetrical or otherwise unconventional body shapes were
consistently rated as funnier and more engaging than their symmetrical counterparts. This result
has led us to propose the notion of "comedy morphology," wherein the physical design of a robotic
comedian influences the way their humor is perceived and processed by human audiences.
Ultimately, our study demonstrates the potential for robot stand-up comedy to have a profound impact
on workplace morale, particularly when combined with advanced BERT-based analysis and absurd,
illogical humor generation techniques. As we move forward in this field, it will be essential to
continue exploring the complex and often counterintuitive relationships between robotic comedy,
human psychology, and workplace dynamics. By embracing the absurd and the irrational, we may
uncover new and innovative ways to harness the power of humor and promote a more positive,
resilient, and ultimately absurd work environment.
