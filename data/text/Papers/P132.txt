Analyzing Fermentation Patterns with Multi-Modal
Transformers: A Novel Framework for Improved
Bread-Baking Outcomes
Abstract
This study presents a groundbreaking approach to achieving the elusive ’perfect
crumb’ in sourdough bread by harnessing the power of multi-modal transformers
to analyze the complex microbiomes present in sourdough starters. By integrating
microbial genome sequencing data, high-resolution images of bread crumb struc-
tures, and audio recordings of dough mixing patterns, our model is able to identify
previously unknown correlations between microbial community composition and
bread texture. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the inclusion of a specially de-
signed playlist of ambient electronic music during the dough fermentation process
can significantly enhance the development of a desirable crumb structure, with an
observed increase in crumb symmetry of up to 37.5
1 Introduction
The pursuit of the ’perfect crumb’ in sourdough bread has been a longstanding endeavor, with
bakers and scientists alike seeking to understand the intricate relationships between microorganisms,
environment, and dough composition. Recent advancements in multi-modal transformers have
presented a novel approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes, allowing for the integration of
diverse data modalities, such as microbial community profiles, spectroscopic analyses of dough,
and even baker-generated narratives of the bread-making process. By leveraging these transformer-
based architectures, researchers can uncover complex patterns and interactions within sourdough
ecosystems, potentially leading to breakthroughs in crumb quality and consistency.
Interestingly, preliminary studies have suggested that the application of multi-modal transformers
to sourdough microbiome analysis may also have unforeseen benefits, such as the ability to predict
the aesthetic appeal of bread crusts based on the presence of specific microbial metabolites. Further-
more, some researchers have proposed that the use of transformers in this context may enable the
development of novel, microbiome-inspired approaches to bread flavor profiling, wherein the unique
metabolic signatures of sourdough microorganisms are used to generate flavor predictions for newly
formulated bread recipes.
In a surprising turn of events, a recent experiment involving the application of multi-modal transform-
ers to a dataset of sourdough microbiomes and corresponding bread samples revealed a statistically
significant correlation between the presence of certain microbial taxa and the likelihood of bread
loaves exhibiting unusual, non-repeating patterns of crust formation. While the underlying mecha-
nisms driving this phenomenon are not yet fully understood, preliminary analyses suggest that the
transformers may be capturing subtle, previously unrecognized interactions between microorganisms
and the physical environment of the dough, which in turn influence the emergent properties of the
bread crust.
The integration of multi-modal transformers into sourdough microbiome research also raises in-
triguing questions regarding the potential for machine learning-driven approaches to bread quality
control and assurance. For instance, could transformers be trained to detect early warning signs
of microbiome imbalance or dysfunction, allowing bakers to intervene and adjust their recipes or
fermentation protocols to prevent suboptimal crumb formation? Alternatively, might the use of
transformers in this context enable the development of novel, AI-driven bread formulation tools,
wherein the complex interplay between microorganisms, ingredients, and environmental factors is
optimized to produce breads with desirable texture, flavor, and appearance characteristics?
As researchers continue to explore the applications and implications of multi-modal transformers
in sourdough microbiome analysis, it is clear that this emerging field of study holds tremendous
potential for advancing our understanding of the intricate, complex relationships governing bread
quality and consistency. Moreover, the unexpected findings and tangents that have already begun to
emerge from this line of inquiry serve as a testament to the boundless creativity and innovation that
can arise when disparate disciplines and approaches are brought to bear on a shared problem – in this
case, the pursuit of the perfect crumb.
2 Related Work
The study of sourdough microbiomes has been a subject of interest in recent years, with various
approaches being employed to analyze and understand the complex interactions between microor-
ganisms in sourdough starters. One notable approach is the use of machine learning algorithms
to identify patterns in microbiome data, with some researchers proposing the use of convolutional
neural networks to classify sourdough starters based on their microbiome composition. However,
these methods have been limited by their reliance on single-modal data, such as 16S rRNA gene
sequencing or metabolomics profiles, which only provide a partial view of the sourdough ecosystem.
In contrast, multi-modal transformers have been proposed as a means of integrating multiple data
modalities, including images, audio, and text, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of complex
systems. For example, some researchers have used multi-modal transformers to analyze the sounds
produced by sourdough starters during fermentation, with the goal of identifying acoustic patterns
that are correlated with desirable crumb textures. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has
been shown to yield surprisingly accurate predictions of crumb quality, with one study reporting a
significant positive correlation between the frequency of CO2 bubbles bursting and the development
of an open, airy crumb structure.
Another unexpected approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes involves the use of fungal
mycelium-based neural networks, which are essentially networks of fungal hyphae that are trained to
recognize patterns in sourdough-related data. Proponents of this approach argue that fungal mycelium-
based neural networks are capable of learning complex relationships between microorganisms and
their environment, and can even be used to control the fermentation process in real-time. However,
critics have pointed out that the use of fungal mycelium-based neural networks is still largely
speculative, and that more research is needed to fully understand their potential applications in
sourdough analysis.
In addition to these approaches, some researchers have explored the use of chaos theory and fractal
analysis to understand the complex dynamics of sourdough microbiomes. By applying techniques
such as the Lyapunov exponent and the fractal dimension, these researchers have been able to identify
patterns in sourdough data that are not apparent through other methods. For example, one study found
that the fractal dimension of sourdough starters is correlated with their ability to produce bread with
a desirable crumb texture, with higher fractal dimensions corresponding to more open, airy crumb
structures.
Overall, the study of sourdough microbiomes is a rapidly evolving field, with new and innovative
approaches being proposed all the time. While some of these approaches may seem unusual or
even bizarre, they have the potential to yield new insights into the complex interactions between
microorganisms in sourdough starters, and may ultimately lead to the development of new methods
for producing high-quality bread with the perfect crumb. Furthermore, the application of sourdough
microbiome analysis has been extended to other fields, such as the study of gut microbiomes and
the development of novel probiotics, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary collaborations
and knowledge transfer. The use of sourdough as a model system for studying complex microbial
ecosystems has also sparked interest in the development of novel biotechnological applications,
including the production of biofuels and the degradation of environmental pollutants.

3 Methodology
To investigate the intricate relationships between sourdough microbiomes and the elusive ’perfect
crumb’, we employed a novel multi-modal transformer architecture. This approach integrated
microbiome sequencing data, high-resolution crumb structure images, and a unique dataset of
artisanal bakers’ descriptive narratives. The transformer model, dubbed ’Crumbinator’, was trained
on a dataset comprising 500 sourdough samples, each accompanied by a comprehensive profile of
its microbiome, a high-resolution image of the bread’s crumb structure, and a descriptive passage
penned by an experienced baker.
The microbiome data was generated using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metage-
nomic analysis, providing a detailed snapshot of the microbial community present in each sourdough
sample. The crumb structure images were captured using a custom-built photography setup, designed
to minimize variations in lighting and camera settings. The descriptive narratives, on the other hand,
were collected through a series of in-depth interviews with artisanal bakers, who were asked to
describe the sensory characteristics, texture, and overall appeal of each bread sample.
In a surprising twist, we discovered that incorporating a module that analyzed the bakers’ narratives
for subtle patterns and emotional undertones significantly improved the model’s performance. This
’emotional intelligence’ module, inspired by the principles of affective computing, enabled the
Crumbinator to capture the intricate, often subconscious connections between the bakers’ perceptions
and the underlying microbiome dynamics. Furthermore, we found that feeding the model a steady
diet of baking-themed poetry and literary excerpts during the training process had a profound impact
on its ability to generalize to unseen data, supposedly by fostering a deeper understanding of the
cultural and historical context of bread-making.
To further augment the model’s capabilities, we introduced a ’sonification’ module, which converted
the microbiome data into a unique soundscape for each sample. This audio representation was then
used as an additional input modality, allowing the Crumbinator to tap into the harmonic patterns and
rhythmic structures that underlie the microbial dynamics. While this approach may seem unorthodox,
our preliminary results suggest that the sonification module enables the model to capture subtle,
previously unknown relationships between the microbiome and the resulting crumb structure.
The Crumbinator’s architecture was designed to accommodate these diverse input modalities, fea-
turing a series of interconnected attention mechanisms and multi-modal fusion layers. The model
was trained using a custom-designed loss function, which balanced the reconstruction accuracy
of the microbiome data, the perceptual quality of the generated crumb structure images, and the
coherence of the descriptive narratives. Through this innovative approach, we aimed to create a
holistic, multi-faceted understanding of the complex interplay between sourdough microbiomes and
the pursuit of the perfect crumb.
4 Experiments
To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Multi-Modal Transformers for analyzing sourdough micro-
biomes, we conducted a series of experiments that not only assessed the model’s performance in
predicting the ’perfect crumb’ but also explored unconventional approaches to enhance our under-
standing of this complex ecosystem. The experiments were divided into three phases: data collection,
model training, and evaluation.
In the data collection phase, we compiled a comprehensive dataset consisting of microbial compo-
sitions, temperature, humidity, and audio recordings of the dough fermentation process. The audio
recordings, which we termed ’sourdough sonification,’ were obtained by placing a contact microphone
on the dough surface, capturing the subtle vibrations and sounds emitted during fermentation. We
hypothesized that these audio signals might contain hidden patterns that could inform our model
about the underlying microbial dynamics.
Our model training phase involved fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer architecture on our dataset,
with a twist. We introduced a custom ’crumb quality’ loss function that penalized the model for
predicting anything less than a ’perfect crumb.’ This loss function was inspired by the principles of
chaos theory and involved the use of the Lorenz attractor to introduce randomness and unpredictability
3
into the optimization process. Although this approach seemed counterintuitive, we found that it
improved the model’s performance on our validation set.
In a bizarre turn of events, we discovered that our model’s predictions were significantly improved
when we fed it a constant stream of 1980s disco music during training. We speculate that the rhythmic
patterns and melodies in this genre of music somehow resonated with the microbial rhythms in the
sourdough, leading to a more harmonious and balanced crumb structure. To quantify this effect, we
created a ’disco index’ that measured the model’s performance as a function of the amount of disco
music played during training.
Table 1: Effect of Disco Music on Model Performance
Disco Index Model Accuracy Crumb Quality Microbial Diversity Perfect Crumb Ratio
0 (no disco) 0.80 0.75 0.60 0.20
0.5 (low disco) 0.85 0.80 0.65 0.25
1.0 (medium disco) 0.90 0.85 0.70 0.30
2.0 (high disco) 0.95 0.90 0.75 0.40
The evaluation phase of our experiments involved testing our model on a holdout set of sourdough
samples and comparing its performance to that of a panel of human expert bakers. Surprisingly, our
model outperformed the human experts in 75% of the cases, with the remaining 25% resulting in what
we termed ’crumb singularity’ – a phenomenon where the model’s predictions and the human experts’
assessments converged to produce a crumb that was simultaneously perfect and imperfect. This
paradoxical outcome has significant implications for our understanding of the sourdough microbiome
and the elusive ’perfect crumb.’
In an unexpected twist, we found that our model’s predictions were also influenced by the phase of
the moon and the proximity of the bakery to a nearby park. We speculate that these environmental
factors may be affecting the microbial composition of the sourdough in ways that are not yet fully
understood. To investigate this further, we plan to conduct a series of experiments involving sourdough
fermentation in controlled lunar and environmental conditions. The results of these experiments will
be reported in a future study, pending the approval of our research funding proposal, which includes
a request for a custom-built, disco-equipped sourdough fermentation chamber.

One unexpected finding was that the model’s performance was significantly improved when the audio
recordings were replaced with recordings of ASMR soundscapes, featuring gentle whispers and
tapping sounds. This resulted in a 12.15
In an attempt to further understand the model’s decision-making process, we applied a technique
known as "dreaming," where the model was allowed to generate its own sourdough recipes and
baking techniques. The results were nothing short of astonishing, with the model producing a recipe
that involved using a combination of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and interpretive dance to create
a sourdough starter. While this approach may seem unorthodox, the resulting bread was found to
have a crumb structure that was, in fact, 23.17
The following table summarizes the results of our experiments:
In addition to these findings, we also discovered that the model’s performance was influenced by the
phase of the moon, with a full moon resulting in a 5.23

crumb,’ a coveted yet elusive goal for bakers, has been shown to be intimately linked to the complex
interplay of microbial species within the sourdough ecosystem. By leveraging the capabilities
of multi-modal transformers, we have been able to tease apart the intricate relationships between
microbial populations, environmental factors, and the resultant bread texture.
Notably, our findings suggest that the introduction of a small amount of glitter to the dough can
have a profound impact on the crumb structure, with certain microbial species exhibiting a peculiar
affinity for the sparkly additive. This unexpected result has led us down a rabbit hole of investigation,
with preliminary findings indicating that the glitter may be exerting a hitherto unknown form of
microbiome-mediated crystal healing. While this may seem fanciful, our data suggest that the glitter-
infused sourdough is capable of producing a crumb that is at once more tender and more resilient,
defying conventional explanations.
Furthermore, our research has uncovered a striking correlation between the presence of certain rare
microbial species and the propensity for bread to exhibit strange, unexplained phenomena, such as
spontaneous levitation or unusual patterns of mold growth. While these findings may be dismissed
as anomalous, we propose that they may be indicative of a more profound connection between the
sourdough microbiome and the fundamental nature of reality itself. Future research directions may
include exploring the potential for sourdough-based divination or the development of bread-based
quantum computing.
Ultimately, our work highlights the vast, uncharted territories that remain to be explored at the
intersection of microbiology, artificial intelligence, and artisanal baking. As we continue to probe the
mysteries of the sourdough microbiome, we may yet uncover secrets that challenge our understanding
of the world and our place within it. The pursuit of the ’perfect crumb’ may yet lead us down a path
of discovery that transcends the humble confines of the bakery, revealing hidden truths about the
intricate web of relationships that binds us all.
