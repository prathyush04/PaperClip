1 Introduction
The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement
learning (RL) agents [1, 2], where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time.
This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL
agents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or
hyperparameter tuning [3, 4], which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. Our
work introduces a novel intervention, termed "plasticity injection," designed to directly tackle the
root causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared
to existing methods, addressing the limitations of previous strategies that often involve extensive
hyperparameter searches or complex architectural changes. The core innovation lies in its ability
to proactively diagnose and mitigate plasticity loss without significantly increasing computational
demands.
Plasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for
identifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability
allows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant, preventing
catastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The
diagnostic framework leverages novel metrics that capture subtle changes in network behavior,
providing early warning signals of impending plasticity loss. This proactive approach contrasts with
reactive methods that only address plasticity loss after significant performance decline has already
occurred.
Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of
trainable parameters or alterations to the network’s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the
computational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This
is achieved through a carefully designed mechanism that selectively modifies the network’s internal
dynamics rather than its overall architecture. This targeted approach minimizes the risk of disrupting
the agent’s learned behavior while effectively addressing the underlying causes of plasticity loss.
The preservation of prediction capabilities is crucial for maintaining the agent’s performance in its
operational environment.
Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved
computational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary
resource consumption during periods of stable performance. The dynamic expansion mechanism is
triggered by the diagnostic framework, ensuring that resources are allocated only when needed to
.
address emerging plasticity loss. This adaptive approach contrasts with static methods that allocate
fixed resources regardless of the agent’s learning dynamics, leading to potential inefficiencies. The
dynamic nature of plasticity injection contributes to its overall efficiency and scalability.
The effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,
including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate a
consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. The modular design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL
algorithms and architectures, enhancing its applicability and impact on the field. Further research
will explore its integration with other advanced RL techniques and its application to more complex
real-world scenarios.
2 Related Work
The problem of plasticity loss, or catastrophic forgetting, in neural networks has been extensively
studied across various machine learning domains [1, 2]. In the context of deep reinforcement learning
(RL), this phenomenon manifests as a decline in an agent’s ability to learn new tasks or adapt
to changing environments after it has already acquired a certain level of proficiency. Traditional
approaches to mitigate this issue often involve architectural modifications, such as employing separate
networks for different tasks [3], or utilizing techniques like regularization and replay buffers [4, 5] to
preserve previously learned knowledge. However, these methods can be computationally expensive,
particularly for large-scale RL agents, and may not always effectively prevent plasticity loss in
complex scenarios. Furthermore, many existing methods focus on reactive solutions, addressing
plasticity loss only after it has already occurred, rather than proactively preventing it. Our work differs
significantly by introducing a proactive diagnostic framework coupled with a targeted intervention
that minimizes computational overhead.
Several studies have explored the use of dynamic network architectures to improve the efficiency and
adaptability of RL agents [6, 7]. These approaches often involve mechanisms for adding or removing
neurons or layers based on the agent’s performance or the complexity of the environment. However,
these methods typically focus on optimizing the network’s overall structure rather than directly
addressing the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss. In contrast, our plasticity injection method
selectively modifies the network’s internal dynamics without altering its overall architecture, allowing
for a more targeted and efficient approach to mitigating plasticity loss. This targeted approach avoids
the potential disruption of learned policies that can occur with more drastic architectural changes.
The dynamic capacity expansion in our method is also triggered by a diagnostic framework, ensuring
that resources are allocated only when necessary, unlike many existing dynamic architecture methods
that may allocate resources inefficiently.
Another line of research focuses on improving the stability and robustness of RL training through
techniques such as curriculum learning [8] and meta-learning [9]. Curriculum learning gradually
introduces increasingly complex tasks to the agent, allowing it to build a robust foundation of
knowledge before tackling more challenging problems. Meta-learning aims to train agents that
can quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data. While these methods can indirectly
contribute to mitigating plasticity loss by improving the agent’s overall learning stability, they do not
directly address the specific mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Our approach complements
these methods by providing a targeted intervention that directly tackles the root causes of plasticity
loss, enhancing the effectiveness of existing training strategies. The diagnostic component of our
framework also offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, which can
inform the development of even more effective training strategies.
The concept of "plasticity" itself has been extensively studied in neuroscience [10, 11], where it refers
to the brain’s ability to adapt and reorganize its structure and function in response to experience.
Our work draws inspiration from these neuroscientific findings, aiming to emulate the brain’s ability
to dynamically adjust its internal mechanisms to maintain learning capacity over time. However,
unlike biological systems, our approach focuses on developing computationally efficient and scalable
methods for achieving this dynamic adaptation in artificial neural networks. The modular design
of our plasticity injection framework allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and
architectures, making it a versatile tool for enhancing the robustness and longevity of RL agents
across a wide range of applications. Future research will explore the integration of plasticity injection
2
with other advanced RL techniques, such as hierarchical RL and multi-agent RL, to further expand
its applicability and impact.
3 Methodology
The core of our approach, termed "plasticity injection," revolves around three interconnected compo-
nents: a diagnostic framework, a mitigation strategy, and a dynamic capacity allocation mechanism.
These components work in concert to proactively identify, address, and adapt to the onset of plasticity
loss in RL agents. The diagnostic framework continuously monitors key network metrics during
training, providing early warning signals of potential plasticity loss. These metrics are carefully
selected to capture subtle changes in network behavior that might precede significant performance
degradation. We employ a combination of established metrics, such as learning rate decay and loss
function fluctuations, alongside novel metrics specifically designed to detect subtle shifts in the
network’s internal representations. These novel metrics are based on analyzing the distribution of
activations within different layers of the network, providing a more granular understanding of the
network’s internal dynamics. The choice of metrics is informed by our preliminary experiments and
theoretical analysis of plasticity loss mechanisms. The diagnostic framework outputs a plasticity
score, a continuous value reflecting the severity of detected plasticity loss. This score serves as a
trigger for the mitigation and capacity allocation mechanisms.
Our mitigation strategy focuses on selectively modifying the network’s internal dynamics rather than
its overall architecture. This targeted approach avoids the computational overhead and potential
disruption of learned policies associated with architectural modifications. The strategy involves a
carefully designed set of operations applied to the network’s weight matrices and biases. These
operations are guided by the plasticity score, with stronger interventions applied when the score
indicates a higher level of plasticity loss. The specific operations are chosen to enhance the network’s
ability to learn new information without disrupting previously acquired knowledge. We explore
several different operation types, including weight normalization, regularization techniques, and
targeted pruning of less relevant connections. The optimal set of operations and their parameters are
determined through a hyperparameter search conducted on a subset of our benchmark tasks. The
effectiveness of the mitigation strategy is evaluated by comparing the long-term performance of
agents with and without plasticity injection.
The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism complements the mitigation strategy by adaptively
expanding the network’s capacity only when necessary. This mechanism is triggered by the plasticity
score, with the degree of capacity expansion directly proportional to the severity of detected plasticity
loss. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network, with
the specific architecture of the added components determined based on the nature of the detected
plasticity loss. For instance, if the diagnostic framework identifies a loss of capacity in a specific
layer, new neurons are added to that layer. This targeted approach ensures that resources are allocated
efficiently, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead during periods of stable performance. The
added capacity is integrated seamlessly into the existing network architecture, minimizing disruption
to the learned policy. The effectiveness of the dynamic capacity allocation is evaluated by comparing
the computational efficiency and long-term performance of agents with and without this mechanism.
The entire plasticity injection framework is implemented as a modular component that can be easily
integrated with various RL algorithms and architectures. This modularity allows for flexibility and
adaptability to different RL tasks and environments. The framework is designed to be computationally
efficient, minimizing the overhead associated with diagnosis, mitigation, and capacity allocation. The
computational efficiency is achieved through careful optimization of the algorithms and data structures
used in each component. The framework’s performance is evaluated across a range of challenging RL
benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. The results
demonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.
Our experimental setup involves a rigorous evaluation across diverse RL environments, encompassing
both continuous control tasks and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We
compare the performance of RL agents employing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art
baselines, including those utilizing established techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The
evaluation metrics include long-term performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency.

4 Experiments
Our experimental evaluation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of plasticity injection in mitigating
plasticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance of RL agents. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of challenging RL environments, encompassing both continuous control tasks
and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). These environments represent a
range of complexities, requiring agents to adapt to varying degrees of uncertainty and dynamic
changes. The selection of these environments ensures a robust evaluation of the generalizability
and robustness of our proposed method. We compare the performance of RL agents employing
plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those utilizing established
techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, such as experience replay and regularization
methods. The baselines are carefully selected to represent a range of existing approaches, allowing for
a comprehensive comparison. The experimental setup is designed to isolate the effects of plasticity
injection, ensuring that any observed performance improvements can be directly attributed to our
proposed method. We meticulously control for confounding factors, such as hyperparameter settings
and training procedures, to maintain the integrity of the experimental results.
The evaluation metrics employed in our experiments include long-term performance, learning stability,
and computational efficiency. Long-term performance is measured by the average cumulative reward
obtained by the agent over an extended training period. Learning stability is assessed by analyzing
the variance in the agent’s performance over time, with lower variance indicating greater stability.
Computational efficiency is evaluated by measuring the training time and resource consumption
of the agents. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the overall effectiveness of
plasticity injection. We utilize statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOV A, to determine the statistical
significance of the observed performance differences between the agents with and without plasticity
injection. The significance level is set at α= 0.05for all statistical tests. The detailed results of these
statistical analyses are presented in the following subsections.
To further analyze the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we
conduct ablation studies. These studies involve systematically removing individual components of
the framework and evaluating the resulting performance. By comparing the performance of the full
framework to the performance of the framework with individual components removed, we can isolate
the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement. This allows us to gain a
deeper understanding of the interplay between the diagnostic framework, the mitigation strategy, and
the dynamic capacity allocation mechanism. The results of these ablation studies provide valuable
insights into the design and optimization of the plasticity injection framework. The findings from
these studies inform future improvements and refinements to the framework.

5 Results
Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of plasticity injection in mitigating plas-
ticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance and learning stability of reinforcement learning
(RL) agents. We conducted experiments across a diverse set of challenging RL environments, includ-
ing continuous control tasks (e.g., MuJoCo tasks such as HalfCheetah, Ant, Hopper) and partially
observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) (e.g., variations of the gridworld environment
with hidden states). These environments were chosen to represent a range of complexities and to
rigorously test the generalizability of our approach. We compared the performance of RL agents
utilizing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those employing
experience replay [4, 5] and regularization techniques [3]. The baselines were carefully selected
to represent a range of existing approaches for addressing catastrophic forgetting, allowing for a
comprehensive comparison. Our experimental setup was designed to isolate the effects of plasticity
injection, ensuring that any observed performance improvements could be directly attributed to our
proposed method. We meticulously controlled for confounding factors, such as hyperparameter
settings and training procedures, to maintain the integrity of the experimental results. All experiments
were run with three different random seeds for each environment and baseline, and the results were
averaged.
The evaluation metrics included long-term performance (average cumulative reward over 1000
episodes), learning stability (measured by the standard deviation of cumulative reward over the
last 200 episodes), and computational efficiency (training time and memory usage). Long-term
performance was chosen to directly assess the ability of the method to prevent plasticity loss over
extended training. Learning stability was included to quantify the consistency of performance over
time. Computational efficiency was evaluated to demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach.
We employed statistical tests, specifically paired t-tests, to determine the statistical significance of
the observed performance differences between agents with and without plasticity injection. The
significance level was set at α= 0.05for all statistical tests.

Gridworld-POMDP-B 110 ±8 90 ±12
Table 1 presents a summary of our experimental results. The results consistently demonstrate
a statistically significant improvement in average cumulative reward when plasticity injection is
employed across all environments (p<0.05 for all environments). Furthermore, the standard deviation
of the cumulative reward was significantly lower for agents using plasticity injection, indicating
improved learning stability. These findings strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method
in mitigating plasticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance of RL agents. Detailed results,
including individual episode rewards and learning curves, are provided in the supplementary material.
To further analyze the contribution of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we
conducted ablation studies. These studies involved systematically removing individual components
(diagnostic framework, mitigation strategy, dynamic capacity allocation) and evaluating the resulting
performance. The results (detailed in the supplementary material) showed that all three components
contributed significantly to the overall performance improvement. Removing any single component
resulted in a substantial decrease in both average cumulative reward and learning stability, highlighting
5
the synergistic interaction between the components. The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism
proved particularly crucial in maintaining computational efficiency while preventing performance
degradation in complex environments. The diagnostic framework effectively identified the onset
of plasticity loss, allowing for timely intervention by the mitigation strategy. This combination
of proactive diagnosis and targeted mitigation proved highly effective in preventing catastrophic
forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The modular
design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and architectures,
enhancing its applicability and impact on the field.
