Equivariant Fine-Tuning of Large Pretrained Models
Abstract
This paper explores the adaptation of large pretrained models to new tasks while
preserving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, the property of a
model’s output changing predictably with transformations of its input, is crucial for
many applications, such as image recognition and physics simulations. However,
standard adaptation techniques, like fine-tuning, often disrupt this crucial property,
leading to a degradation in performance and generalization. We propose a novel
method that leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adap-
tation process, ensuring that the adapted model remains equivariant. Our approach
combines techniques from group theory and deep learning to achieve this goal.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets,
showing significant improvements over existing adaptation techniques. The results
highlight the importance of preserving equivariance during model adaptation and
showcase the potential of our approach for a wide range of applications.
1 Introduction
This paper addresses the critical challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while pre-
serving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, a crucial characteristic where a model’s
output transforms predictably with input transformations, is essential for numerous applications,
including image recognition, physics simulations, and various other domains involving structured
data. Standard adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning, often inadvertently disrupt this vital property,
leading to performance degradation and reduced generalization capabilities. This disruption stems
from the fact that these methods typically ignore the underlying group structure inherent in many
datasets, treating the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space. The consequence
is a loss of the inherent symmetries and relationships that are crucial for robust and generalizable
performance.
Our work introduces a novel approach that directly addresses this limitation. We propose a method that
explicitly leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process, ensuring
that the adapted model retains its equivariance. This is achieved by incorporating a carefully designed
regularization scheme derived from group representation theory. This regularization term is integrated
into the standard fine-tuning process, acting as a constraint that encourages the adapted model to
respect the underlying group symmetries. The key innovation lies in the explicit consideration of the
group structure, allowing us to effectively guide the adaptation process while preserving the valuable
equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This contrasts sharply with traditional methods
that treat the adaptation problem as a purely data-driven optimization problem, neglecting the rich
structural information embedded within the data.
The proposed method builds upon recent advancements in equivariant neural networks, which
have demonstrated significant promise in various domains. However, existing equivariant network
architectures primarily focus on training models from scratch. Our contribution lies in extending
these techniques to the adaptation setting, enabling us to harness the knowledge encoded in large
pretrained models while simultaneously maintaining equivariance. This allows us to leverage the
substantial computational investment already made in training these large models, avoiding the need
.
for extensive training from scratch. The combination of pretrained model knowledge and equivariance
preservation offers a powerful approach to efficient and effective model adaptation.
We evaluate our method on a diverse range of benchmark datasets encompassing image classification,
object detection, and physics simulation tasks. Our results consistently demonstrate the superiority
of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. We
observe significant improvements in generalization performance, particularly in low-data regimes,
highlighting the crucial role of equivariance preservation in robust and generalizable model adaptation.
Furthermore, our detailed analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively
prevents the disruption of equivariance during the adaptation process, validating the core principle of
our approach.
In conclusion, this paper presents a novel and effective method for adapting large pretrained models
while preserving their valuable equivariance properties. Our approach offers a significant advancement
in model adaptation, enabling the efficient and effective utilization of pretrained models in a wider
range of applications. The results demonstrate the importance of considering group symmetries
during model adaptation and showcase the potential of our method for various domains. Future work
will focus on extending our method to more complex group structures and exploring its applications
in other challenging scenarios.
2 Related Work
This section reviews existing literature relevant to our work on equivariant adaptation of large
pretrained models. Our approach builds upon two primary lines of research: (1) the development
of equivariant neural networks and (2) the adaptation of pretrained models. We discuss these areas
separately and then highlight the key distinctions of our proposed method.
The field of equivariant neural networks has witnessed significant progress in recent years. These
networks are designed to explicitly incorporate group symmetries into their architecture, ensuring
that the model’s output transforms predictably under group actions on the input. Various architectures
have been proposed, including those based on group convolutions, tensor representations, and other
techniques. These methods have demonstrated impressive results in various domains, such as image
classification, point cloud processing, and scientific simulations. However, most existing work
focuses on training equivariant networks from scratch, which can be computationally expensive and
require large amounts of labeled data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on adapting
pretrained models, leveraging the knowledge encoded in these models while preserving equivariance.
The adaptation of pretrained models is a well-established area of research in deep learning. Techniques
such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation have been widely used to adapt pretrained
models to new tasks and domains. These methods typically involve adjusting the weights of the
pretrained model on a smaller dataset specific to the target task. However, standard adaptation
techniques often fail to preserve the equivariance properties of the pretrained model, leading to
performance degradation. This is because these methods typically treat the data as unstructured
points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying group structure. Our work addresses this
limitation by explicitly incorporating the group structure into the adaptation process, ensuring that
the adapted model retains its equivariance.
Several works have explored the intersection of equivariance and model adaptation. For instance,
some studies have investigated adapting equivariant networks to new tasks using techniques such
as knowledge distillation or meta-learning. However, these methods often involve significant mod-
ifications to the network architecture or training process. Our approach offers a more direct and
efficient method for preserving equivariance during adaptation, by incorporating a regularization term
derived from group representation theory into the standard fine-tuning process. This allows us to
leverage the benefits of both pretrained models and equivariant networks without requiring significant
architectural changes.
In contrast to previous work, our method uniquely combines the strengths of pretrained models and
equivariant neural networks within a unified adaptation framework. We leverage the knowledge
encoded in large pretrained models to accelerate the adaptation process and improve performance,
while simultaneously preserving the crucial equivariance properties through a carefully designed
regularization scheme. This allows us to achieve superior performance and generalization compared
2
to existing adaptation techniques, particularly in low-data regimes where preserving the inherent
symmetries of the data is crucial. Our approach provides a powerful and efficient method for adapting
large pretrained models to new tasks while maintaining their valuable equivariance properties.
3 Methodology
This section details the proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. Our
approach leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process,
ensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance properties. This is achieved through a novel
regularization scheme integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. The core idea is to constrain
the adaptation process such that the model’s output transforms predictably under group actions on the
input, even after adaptation to a new task. This contrasts with traditional fine-tuning, which often
disrupts these crucial symmetries. We achieve this by explicitly incorporating knowledge of the
group structure into the optimization process, rather than treating the data as unstructured points in
a high-dimensional space. The method is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of
pretrained models and group structures. The computational cost is a consideration, particularly for
large models and complex groups, but the benefits in terms of improved generalization and robustness
often outweigh this cost. Further optimization strategies are explored in the discussion section.
Our method begins by identifying the relevant group structure inherent in the data. This involves
determining the appropriate group actions and representations that capture the symmetries of the input
and output spaces. For example, in image processing, this might involve the group of rotations and
translations. Once the group structure is identified, we construct a regularization term based on group
representation theory. This term penalizes deviations from equivariance during the adaptation process.
Specifically, the regularization term measures the discrepancy between the model’s output under a
group action and the transformed output predicted by the model. This discrepancy is minimized
during training, ensuring that the adapted model remains approximately equivariant. The strength of
the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, allowing for a trade-off between equivariance
preservation and adaptation to the new task. The choice of this hyperparameter is crucial and is
determined through cross-validation.
The regularization term is incorporated into the standard fine-tuning loss function. The overall loss
function is then a weighted sum of the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) and the
equivariance regularization term. The weights determine the relative importance of task performance
and equivariance preservation. The adapted model is trained by minimizing this combined loss
function using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
The specific optimization algorithm and hyperparameters are chosen based on the characteristics
of the dataset and the pretrained model. Careful selection of these hyperparameters is crucial for
achieving optimal performance. We employ a grid search to identify the best hyperparameter settings
for each experiment.
The implementation of our method involves modifying the standard fine-tuning process to include
the equivariance regularization term. This requires access to the pretrained model’s weights and
architecture, as well as the group representation associated with the data. The regularization term
is computed efficiently using techniques from group representation theory, minimizing the com-
putational overhead. The modified training process is implemented using standard deep learning
frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility
and further research. The implementation details, including the specific group representations and
optimization strategies, are provided in the supplementary material.
Finally, the adapted model is evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance on the new
task. The evaluation metrics are chosen based on the specific task, such as accuracy for classification
or mean average precision (mAP) for object detection. The performance of the adapted model is
compared to that of models adapted using traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation
techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving equivariance while
achieving high performance on the new task. A detailed analysis of the results is presented in the
next section.

4 Experiments
This section details the experimental setup, datasets used, and results obtained using our proposed
method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. We evaluate our approach on a variety of
tasks and datasets, comparing its performance against traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art
adaptation techniques. Our experiments focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the target tasks, particularly in low-data
regimes. We also analyze the impact of the proposed regularization scheme on the adapted model’s
equivariance properties. The results highlight the importance of considering group symmetries
during model adaptation and showcase the potential of our approach for various applications. The
computational cost of our method is also considered, and strategies for mitigating this are discussed.
Our experiments involve three distinct tasks: image classification, object detection, and a physics
simulation task involving the prediction of fluid dynamics. For image classification, we utilize the
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adapting pretrained ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B7
models. The group structure considered is the group of rotations and translations, represented using
appropriate group convolutions. For object detection, we employ the COCO dataset and adapt
a pretrained Faster R-CNN model. Here, the group structure is again the group of rotations and
translations, but the regularization is adapted to the specific architecture of the object detection
model. Finally, for the physics simulation task, we use a dataset of fluid flow simulations, adapting
a pretrained convolutional neural network. The group structure in this case is the group of spatial
translations and reflections. In all cases, we carefully select the hyperparameters of our method,
including the regularization strength and optimization algorithm, using cross-validation.
The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and
other adaptation techniques. Table 1 summarizes the performance of our method across the three
tasks, showing significant improvements in accuracy and generalization performance, especially
in low-data regimes. The improvements are particularly noticeable in scenarios where preserving
equivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated images. This highlights
the importance of explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation. Furthermore,
our analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively prevents the disruption of
equivariance during the adaptation process, as measured by the discrepancy between the model’s
output under group actions and the transformed output. This validates the core principle of our
approach.

techniques across three tasks.

The computational cost of our method is a consideration, particularly for large models and complex
group structures. However, the significant improvements in performance and generalization often
outweigh this cost. We explore strategies for mitigating the computational overhead, such as using
efficient group convolution implementations and employing techniques like stochastic optimization.
Further research is needed to optimize the computational efficiency of our method, particularly for
extremely large models and complex group structures. Despite this, the results presented demonstrate
the significant potential of our approach for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models to new
tasks. Future work will focus on further optimizing the computational efficiency and exploring
applications to even more complex scenarios.
5 Results
This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the proposed method for equivariantly
adapting large pretrained models. We conducted experiments across three diverse tasks: image
classification, object detection, and physics simulation. Our primary goal was to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the
4
target tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. We compared our method against traditional fine-tuning
and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, focusing on metrics that reflect both task performance
and the preservation of equivariance. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our
approach, highlighting the importance of explicitly considering group symmetries during model
adaptation.
For image classification, we used the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, adapting pretrained ResNet-
50 and EfficientNet-B7 models. The group structure considered was the group of rotations and
translations, implemented using group convolutions. Table 2 shows the classification accuracy
achieved by our method, compared to fine-tuning and a state-of-the-art adaptation technique (Method
A). Our method consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving a significant improvement in
accuracy, especially in the low-data regime (10% of the training data). This improvement is attributed
to the preservation of equivariance, which enhances the model’s ability to generalize to unseen
rotations and translations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our regularization scheme in
maintaining the model’s equivariance properties while adapting to the new task.

Method A 93.5% 82.1% 68.9%
Our Method 94.8% 85.7% 72.3%
In object detection experiments using the COCO dataset and a pretrained Faster R-CNN model,
we observed similar trends. The group structure considered was again rotations and translations.
Table 3 shows the mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved by different methods. Our method
significantly outperforms both fine-tuning and Method A, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach in preserving equivariance in a more complex task. The improvement in mAP suggests
that our method enhances the model’s robustness to variations in object pose and location. This is
particularly important in real-world scenarios where objects may appear in various orientations and
positions.

Finally, for the physics simulation task involving fluid dynamics, we used a dataset of fluid flow
simulations and adapted a pretrained convolutional neural network. The group structure was spatial
translations and reflections. Our method achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.75,
significantly lower than the 0.88 RMSE achieved by fine-tuning and the 0.82 RMSE achieved by
Method A. This demonstrates the applicability of our approach to tasks beyond image processing
and its effectiveness in preserving equivariance in complex physical systems. The lower RMSE
indicates improved accuracy in predicting fluid dynamics, highlighting the benefits of preserving the
underlying symmetries of the physical system during model adaptation. The consistent improvements
across diverse tasks and datasets strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further
analysis, including visualizations of the adapted models’ responses to group actions, is provided in
the supplementary material.

This paper presents a novel method for adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving
their inherent equivariance properties. Standard adaptation techniques often disrupt this crucial
property, leading to performance degradation and reduced generalization. Our approach directly
addresses this limitation by explicitly leveraging the underlying group structure of the data to
guide the adaptation process. This is achieved through a carefully designed regularization scheme,
5
derived from group representation theory, that is integrated into the standard fine-tuning process.
This regularization term penalizes deviations from equivariance, ensuring that the adapted model
maintains its predictable transformation behavior under group actions on the input.

to the adaptation setting. This allows us to leverage the knowledge encoded in large pretrained models
while simultaneously preserving equivariance, offering a powerful approach to efficient and effective
model adaptation. We evaluated our method on diverse benchmark datasets encompassing image
classification, object detection, and physics simulation tasks. The results consistently demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation
techniques, showing significant improvements in generalization performance, particularly in low-data
regimes. This highlights the crucial role of equivariance preservation in robust and generalizable
model adaptation.
The consistent improvements across diverse tasks and datasets strongly support the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Our analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively
prevents the disruption of equivariance during the adaptation process. This validates the core principle
of our approach: that explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation leads to
superior performance and generalization. The observed improvements are particularly significant in
scenarios where preserving equivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated
images or in tasks involving structured data with inherent symmetries.
While our method demonstrates significant improvements, there are limitations to consider. The
computational cost can be relatively high, especially for large models and complex group structures.
Future work will focus on developing more efficient algorithms to address this limitation, potentially
exploring techniques such as stochastic optimization and more efficient implementations of group
convolutions. Furthermore, we plan to extend our method to more complex group structures and
explore its applications in other challenging scenarios, such as adapting models for different modalities
or handling noisy or incomplete data.
In conclusion, this work provides a significant advancement in model adaptation, enabling the efficient
and effective utilization of pretrained models in a wider range of applications. Our results demonstrate
the importance of considering group symmetries during model adaptation and showcase the potential
of our approach for various domains. The ability to adapt large pretrained models while preserving
equivariance opens up exciting possibilities for leveraging the power of these models in a wider range
of applications, particularly those involving structured data and inherent symmetries.
