1 Introduction
The objective of this research is to develop an innovative algorithm for accurately estimating the
causal effect of treatment on outcomes in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) when latent
confounders are present. Existing methods often struggle in this scenario, typically requiring
multiple proxy variables to account for the unobserved confounding or relying on strong, often
unrealistic, assumptions about the data generating process. These limitations significantly restrict
the applicability of these methods in real-world settings where obtaining multiple reliable proxies
can be challenging or even impossible. Our proposed approach offers a significant advancement by
leveraging a single proxy variable, combined with information extracted from cross-moments of the
observed variables, to identify and estimate causal effects. This reduction in data requirements makes
our method considerably more practical and widely applicable. The algorithm’s robustness to model
misspecification and its ability to handle high-dimensional data are also key features, enhancing its
utility in complex real-world scenarios.
The core innovation lies in the strategic use of cross-moments to capture the intricate relationships
between the observed variables and the latent confounder. By carefully analyzing these relationships,
our algorithm effectively disentangles the direct effect of the treatment from the indirect effect
mediated by the latent confounder. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the causal effect,
even in the presence of significant confounding bias. The theoretical foundations of the algorithm
are rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and providing a solid basis for its application. We
demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness through extensive simulations, comparing its performance
against state-of-the-art methods under various conditions, including varying levels of confounding
and noise. These simulations highlight the algorithm’s superior accuracy and robustness.
Furthermore, we showcase the practical applicability of our algorithm through real-world case studies.
These applications demonstrate the algorithm’s ability to provide valuable causal insights in settings
.
where traditional methods fail. The algorithm’s efficiency and scalability make it particularly suitable
for large-scale datasets, a significant advantage in the era of big data. This capability addresses
a critical limitation of many existing causal inference techniques, which often struggle with the
computational demands of large datasets. The potential applications of this algorithm extend to
diverse fields, including healthcare, economics, and social sciences, where understanding causal
relationships is crucial for informed decision-making.
Our work contributes significantly to the field of causal inference by providing a practical and
powerful tool for researchers and practitioners. The algorithm’s ability to handle latent confounders
with a single proxy variable represents a major breakthrough, simplifying the data requirements
for causal inference and broadening its accessibility. This simplification is particularly valuable in
situations where data collection is expensive or limited. The algorithm’s robustness and efficiency
make it a promising candidate for widespread adoption in causal inference applications across various
disciplines. Future work will focus on extending the algorithm to handle non-linear SCMs and
exploring its application in more complex causal inference settings, such as those involving multiple
treatments or mediators. The development of user-friendly software implementing this algorithm is
also a priority to facilitate its wider adoption and use.
In summary, this research presents a novel and efficient algorithm for causal inference in the presence
of latent confounders. Its ability to leverage a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and
scalability, makes it a significant contribution to the field. The algorithm’s theoretical foundation and
empirical validation provide strong evidence of its effectiveness and potential for widespread impact.
We believe this work will stimulate further research into the development of more efficient and robust
causal inference techniques, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable causal inferences in
diverse settings.
2 Related Work
Our work builds upon a rich body of literature on causal inference with latent confounders. Traditional
approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as the availability of multiple proxy variables [1,
2] or the imposition of restrictive functional forms on the relationships between variables [3]. These
assumptions can be difficult to justify in practice, limiting the applicability of these methods. For
instance, methods based on instrumental variables [4] require the identification of a variable that
affects the treatment but not the outcome directly, a condition that is often hard to satisfy. Similarly,
techniques relying on conditional independence assumptions [5] may be sensitive to violations of
these assumptions, leading to biased estimates. Our approach offers a significant advantage by
relaxing these stringent requirements.
Several recent works have explored the use of proxy variables for handling latent confounding [6,
7]. However, these methods often require multiple proxies, which can be challenging to obtain in
many real-world applications. Furthermore, the performance of these methods can be sensitive to
the quality and number of proxies used. In contrast, our method leverages a single proxy variable,
making it more practical and robust to the limitations of proxy data. The use of cross-moments
to extract additional information from the observed data is a key innovation that distinguishes our
approach from existing methods.
The use of cross-moments in causal inference has been explored in various contexts [8, 9]. However,
these methods often focus on specific model structures or make strong assumptions about the data
generating process. Our approach provides a more general framework that can handle a wider range
of scenarios. The theoretical guarantees we provide offer a solid foundation for the reliability and
validity of our method, addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. This rigorous theoretical
analysis distinguishes our work from purely empirical approaches.
Our algorithm also addresses the challenge of high-dimensional data, a common issue in modern
causal inference problems. Many existing methods struggle with the computational complexity
associated with high-dimensional data, limiting their applicability to large-scale datasets. Our
method’s efficiency and scalability make it particularly well-suited for such scenarios. This scalability
is achieved through the efficient use of cross-moments and the development of computationally
efficient algorithms. This aspect of our work contributes to the growing need for scalable causal
inference techniques.

Finally, our work contributes to the broader goal of developing more robust and reliable causal
inference methods. The ability to accurately estimate causal effects in the presence of latent con-
founders is crucial for many applications, ranging from healthcare to social sciences. Our method’s
ability to handle latent confounders with a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and
scalability, represents a significant advancement in the field. The development of user-friendly
software implementing this algorithm will further enhance its accessibility and impact.
3 Methodology
Our proposed method leverages a single proxy variable and cross-moments to identify and estimate
causal effects in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with latent confounders. Unlike existing
methods that often require multiple proxy variables or strong assumptions, our approach offers a
more practical and robust solution. The core idea is to exploit the information contained in the
cross-moments of the observed variables to disentangle the direct effect of the treatment from
the indirect effect mediated by the latent confounder. This is achieved by carefully analyzing
the relationships between the observed variables and the single proxy variable, allowing us to
effectively account for the unobserved confounding. The algorithm is designed to be robust to
model misspecification and capable of handling high-dimensional data, making it suitable for a
wide range of real-world applications. The algorithm’s efficiency stems from its ability to directly
utilize cross-moments, avoiding computationally expensive iterative procedures often found in other
methods. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when dealing with large datasets. Furthermore,
the algorithm’s theoretical foundations are rigorously established, providing strong guarantees on
its performance and reliability. The theoretical analysis ensures that the estimated causal effects are
consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. This rigorous theoretical framework
distinguishes our approach from purely empirical methods. The algorithm’s robustness is further
enhanced by its ability to handle noisy data and model misspecification, ensuring reliable results even
in challenging scenarios. The algorithm’s design incorporates techniques to mitigate the impact of
noise and model misspecification, leading to more accurate and stable estimates. The algorithm’s
modular design allows for easy extension and adaptation to different settings.
The algorithm proceeds in three main steps. First, we estimate the cross-moments of the observed
variables, including the treatment, outcome, and proxy variable. These cross-moments capture the
complex relationships between the variables and provide crucial information for identifying the causal
effect. The estimation of these cross-moments is performed using robust statistical techniques that are
resistant to outliers and noise. The choice of estimation method is crucial for ensuring the accuracy
and robustness of the subsequent steps. We employ a method that is both efficient and robust to outliers
and noise, ensuring reliable estimates even in the presence of noisy data. The second step involves
solving a system of equations derived from the estimated cross-moments. This system of equations is
carefully constructed to leverage the information contained in the cross-moments to identify the causal
effect. The solution to this system of equations provides an estimate of the causal effect, accounting
for the latent confounder. The solution is obtained using efficient numerical methods that are designed
to handle potential numerical instabilities. The third step involves constructing confidence intervals
for the estimated causal effect. This step provides a measure of uncertainty associated with the
estimate, allowing for a more complete understanding of the results. The confidence intervals are
constructed using asymptotic theory, providing valid inferences even in large samples. The entire
process is designed to be computationally efficient, allowing for the analysis of large datasets.
The theoretical properties of the algorithm are rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and
validity. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild
conditions. These theoretical guarantees provide a strong foundation for the application of the
algorithm in various settings. The consistency result ensures that the estimator converges to the true
causal effect as the sample size increases. The asymptotic normality result allows for the construction
of valid confidence intervals, providing a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate. The
theoretical analysis also provides insights into the algorithm’s robustness to model misspecification
and the impact of noise. The theoretical results are supported by extensive simulations, demonstrating
the algorithm’s superior performance compared to existing methods. The simulations cover a wide
range of scenarios, including varying levels of confounding and noise, demonstrating the algorithm’s
robustness and accuracy. The theoretical analysis and simulation results provide strong evidence of
