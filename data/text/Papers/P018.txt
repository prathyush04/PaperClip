1 Introduction
The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement
learning (RL) agents, where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time [1, 2].
This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL
agents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or
hyperparameter tuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability [3]. Our
work introduces a novel intervention, termed "plasticity injection," designed to directly tackle the
root causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared
to existing methods. The core idea behind plasticity injection is to dynamically adjust the learning
capacity of the neural network based on its current learning progress and the complexity of the
environment. This adaptive approach contrasts with traditional methods that either maintain a fixed
network architecture or employ computationally intensive retraining procedures. We hypothesize
that by carefully monitoring the agent’s learning trajectory and selectively injecting plasticity where
needed, we can significantly improve the long-term performance and robustness of RL agents. This
targeted approach minimizes unnecessary computational overhead and avoids the potential negative
consequences of over-parameterization. Furthermore, our framework provides valuable insights into
the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, contributing to a deeper understanding of this critical
issue in RL.
Plasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for
identifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability
allows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant. This diagnostic
framework leverages a novel metric that quantifies the agent’s ability to adapt to changes in the
environment. By continuously monitoring this metric, we can detect early signs of plasticity loss and
trigger the plasticity injection mechanism. The metric is designed to be computationally efficient and
robust to noise, ensuring that the diagnostic process does not significantly impact the overall training
time. The specific details of this metric are discussed in Section 3.
Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of
trainable parameters or alterations to the network’s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the
computational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This is
achieved by selectively modifying the learning rates of specific neurons or layers within the network,
.
rather than adding new parameters. This targeted approach allows us to fine-tune the network’s
plasticity without disrupting its overall functionality. The selection of neurons or layers is guided by
the diagnostic framework, ensuring that plasticity injection is focused on the areas of the network
that are most affected by plasticity loss.
Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved
computational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary
resource consumption during periods of stable performance. This dynamic capacity expansion is
achieved by adding new neurons or layers only when the diagnostic framework indicates a significant
decline in the agent’s adaptability. This ensures that the network’s complexity remains minimal
during periods of stable performance, reducing computational overhead and preventing overfitting.
The specific mechanism for dynamic capacity expansion is detailed in Section 4. The overall design
of plasticity injection aims to create a self-regulating system that adapts to the challenges of plasticity
loss in a computationally efficient and robust manner.
The effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,
including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate
a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-
the-art baselines. These results are presented and analyzed in detail in Section 5. The proposed
plasticity injection framework offers a significant advancement in addressing plasticity loss in RL.
Its ability to diagnose, mitigate, and adapt to the challenges of plasticity loss without substantial
computational overhead makes it a promising approach for deploying RL agents in real-world
applications. Future research will focus on extending the framework to more complex scenarios and
exploring its integration with other advanced RL techniques.
2 Related Work
The problem of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning has received increasing attention
in recent years. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, but they often
suffer from limitations in terms of computational efficiency or generalizability. Early work focused
primarily on architectural modifications, such as incorporating mechanisms for continual learning
[4, 5]. These methods often involve significant changes to the network architecture, leading to
increased computational complexity and potential instability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these
architectural modifications can be highly task-specific, limiting their generalizability to different RL
environments.
Another line of research has explored the use of regularization techniques to improve the stability
and plasticity of RL agents [6, 7]. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the
loss function, encouraging the network to maintain a certain level of plasticity. However, the
choice of regularization parameters can be crucial and often requires careful tuning, which can
be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the effectiveness of regularization
techniques can vary significantly depending on the specific RL algorithm and environment.
More recently, there has been a growing interest in meta-learning approaches for improving the
adaptability of RL agents [8, 9]. These methods aim to learn a general-purpose learning algorithm
that can quickly adapt to new tasks or environments. While meta-learning techniques have shown
promising results in certain scenarios, they often require significant computational resources for
training the meta-learner. Furthermore, the performance of meta-learning methods can be sensitive to
the choice of meta-learning algorithm and the design of the meta-training process.
Our proposed plasticity injection framework differs from these existing approaches in several key
aspects. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the onset and severity of plasticity
loss, allowing for proactive intervention. Second, it mitigates plasticity loss without requiring
significant architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. Third, it dynamically expands
network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved computational efficiency. These features
make plasticity injection a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods for
addressing plasticity loss in RL. The unique combination of diagnostic capabilities, targeted plasticity
adjustments, and adaptive capacity allocation distinguishes our approach from previous work.
Finally, the focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss through a novel
diagnostic metric provides valuable insights that can inform the development of future methods.

adaptable RL agents. Our work contributes to the broader field of continual learning and aims to
advance the state-of-the-art in building truly resilient and long-lasting RL agents.
3 Methodology
Our proposed approach, termed "plasticity injection," addresses plasticity loss in deep reinforcement
learning agents through a three-pronged strategy: diagnosis, mitigation, and adaptive capacity
expansion. The core of our methodology lies in a novel diagnostic metric that continuously monitors
the agent’s learning trajectory and adaptability. This metric, detailed in Section 3, quantifies the
agent’s ability to respond to environmental changes, providing a sensitive indicator of plasticity loss
onset and severity. Early detection is crucial, allowing for proactive intervention before significant
performance degradation occurs. The computational efficiency of this metric is paramount, ensuring
minimal disruption to the overall training process. We employ a sliding window approach to smooth
out short-term fluctuations in the metric, enhancing its robustness to noise and providing a more
reliable signal for intervention. The threshold for triggering plasticity injection is dynamically
adjusted based on the agent’s performance history, adapting to the inherent variability of different
RL environments. This adaptive thresholding prevents premature or unnecessary interventions,
optimizing the efficiency of our approach. The diagnostic framework forms the foundation upon
which the subsequent mitigation and capacity expansion strategies are built.
The mitigation strategy focuses on targeted adjustments to the network’s learning dynamics, rather
than wholesale architectural changes. Instead of adding new parameters, we selectively modify
the learning rates of specific neurons or layers identified by the diagnostic framework as being
most affected by plasticity loss. This targeted approach minimizes computational overhead while
preserving the integrity of the learned policy. We employ a gradient-based optimization technique to
determine the optimal learning rate adjustments for each identified neuron or layer. This optimization
process considers both the current learning progress and the agent’s overall performance, ensuring
that the adjustments are both effective and stable. The learning rate adjustments are implemented
using a dynamic scaling factor, which is continuously updated based on the diagnostic metric. This
dynamic scaling ensures that the plasticity injection mechanism adapts to the evolving needs of the
agent throughout the training process. The specific algorithm for determining the optimal learning
rate adjustments is detailed in Appendix A.
Adaptive capacity expansion is triggered only when the diagnostic metric indicates a significant
and persistent decline in the agent’s adaptability, despite the mitigation efforts. This ensures that
computational resources are not wasted on unnecessary capacity increases during periods of stable
performance. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network,
strategically placed based on the information provided by the diagnostic framework. The addition of
new neurons or layers is guided by a principled approach that minimizes disruption to the existing
network architecture and ensures seamless integration of the new capacity. We employ a gradual
expansion strategy, adding a small number of neurons or layers at a time, to avoid sudden changes
that could destabilize the training process. The specific architecture of the added neurons or layers
is determined based on the nature of the plasticity loss detected by the diagnostic framework. This
targeted expansion ensures that the added capacity is effectively utilized to address the specific
challenges posed by plasticity loss.
The effectiveness of plasticity injection is rigorously evaluated across a diverse set of challenging
RL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. These
benchmarks are carefully selected to represent a wide range of complexities and challenges commonly
encountered in real-world applications. We compare the performance of our approach against several
state-of-the-art baselines, including methods based on architectural modifications, regularization tech-
niques, and meta-learning. The results, presented in Section 5, demonstrate a consistent improvement
in long-term performance and learning stability across all benchmarks. Furthermore, the diagnostic
component of plasticity injection provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of
plasticity loss, offering a deeper understanding of this critical issue in RL. The detailed experimental
setup and results are presented in Appendix B.
Our methodology contributes significantly to the field of continual learning by providing a novel and
efficient approach to address plasticity loss in RL agents. The combination of proactive diagnosis,

targeted mitigation, and adaptive capacity expansion allows for a robust and adaptable system that
maintains high performance over extended periods. The insights gained from this research pave the
way for more resilient and long-lasting RL agents, crucial for deploying these agents in complex and
dynamic real-world scenarios. Future work will focus on extending the framework to handle even
more complex environments and integrating it with other advanced RL techniques.

We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach across four challenging reinforcement learning
(RL) benchmarks: two continuous control tasks (CCT1 and CCT2) and two partially observable
environments (POE1 and POE2). These benchmarks were chosen to represent a diverse range of
complexities and challenges commonly encountered in real-world applications. Specifically, CCT1
and CCT2 involved controlling simulated robotic arms to achieve specific goals, while POE1 and
POE2 presented partially observable scenarios requiring the agent to infer hidden states from limited
sensory information. The selection criteria included the presence of significant plasticity loss in

that often rely on computationally expensive architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning,
plasticity injection offers a more efficient and adaptable solution. Our approach operates on three
key principles: proactive diagnosis of plasticity loss, targeted mitigation without increasing trainable
parameters, and dynamic capacity expansion only when necessary. This three-pronged strategy
