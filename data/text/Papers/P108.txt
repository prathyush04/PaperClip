Progress Towards Eliciting Organized Phoneme
Structures
Abstract
Phonological typology, a vital area within linguistic studies, examines the patterns
and functions of sounds across the world’s languages. This paper offers an overview
of completed and ongoing experiments utilizing phonological representations,
derived from typological databases, in speech processing tasks. It primarily focuses
on two lines of inquiry motivated by the need to adapt speech technologies to low-
resource languages and dialects. Initially, a framework is presented for evaluating
the cross-linguistic consistency of phonological characteristics within multilingual
phoneme inventories. Subsequently, an outline is given for a method that could
potentially contribute to the development of future phoneme inventory induction
systems, highlighting the crucial role of phonological typology in this process.
1 Introduction
The field of phonological typology investigates the distribution and functionality of sounds in
languages globally. Typological databases are instrumental in making generalizations in this domain.
These resources are valuable not only for creating probabilistic models of phonological typology but
also for enhancing downstream multilingual NLP, speech technology, and language documentation
efforts.
This paper summarizes our research involving phonological representations in speech processing,
utilizing phonological typology databases. Despite the prevalence of end-to-end approaches in
automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech translation, the integration of
precise phonological knowledge remains essential in various scenarios.
Our research is driven by the goal of extending speech technologies, which still rely on phonological
representations, to under-resourced languages and dialects. We first review a framework designed to
analyze the cross-linguistic consistency of phonological features in multilingual phoneme inventories
obtained from cross-lingual typological databases. We then propose a preliminary method that may
act as a foundational element in a future phoneme inventory induction system, emphasizing the
significance of phonological typology in such an approach.
2 Multilingual Phoneme Inventories
Traditionally, a phoneme is defined as a theoretical concept specific to a single language. Applying
phonemes and their feature encodings across languages presents a challenge: it’s unclear whether all
distinctive features (DFs) will be relevant or applicable in a multilingual phoneme inventory taken
from a typological database. If DF representations were phonetic instead of phonemic, and acoustic
rather than articulatory, one might anticipate a strong correlation between DFs and the acoustic
signal. However, in practical multilingual contexts, these representations are frequently influenced by
phonemic considerations due to the accessibility of phonemic inventories and transcriptions.
Our approach was straightforward: a phonemic contrast is deemed consistent across languages if it
can be reliably predicted in a binary classification task on withheld languages. This problem involves
a segment of a speech signal and a label (e.g., front vowel vs. back vowel). A classifier is trained on a
multilingual, multi-speaker dataset, excluding some languages for later assessment. In cases where
cross-linguistic consistency was lacking, we enhanced the method by basing the representation on
contextual phonological knowledge provided as DFs, excluding the contrast being tested.
Our experiments involved languages from the Dravidian, Indo-European, and Malayo-Polynesian
families, with phoneme inventories sourced from a phonological database. The results are varied. An
experiment designed to predict contrasts in unvoiced labial consonants between specific languages
yielded reliable predictions across languages. Similar consistency was observed for contrasts between
front and back vowels, as well as vowel height and continuant manner of articulation distinctions.
Negative outcomes include the cross-lingual prediction of retroflex consonants between language
families: a predictor trained on Dravidian languages cannot accurately predict retroflex consonants in
another language, and vice versa. The detection of aspiration was similarly inconsistent. Incorporating
other contrasts as contextual features did not result in significant improvement for these complex
cases.
Our research is partly motivated by a persistent question: Can this methodology assess the cross-
linguistic validity of existing phoneme inventories given available data? For example, among the
Malayo-Polynesian languages studied, only one has retroflex consonants, acquired from loanwords
from other language families. Different phoneme inventories exist for this language, one of which
includes retroflex plosives, while another omits them. Determining which representation is superior
in a multilingual pronunciation model remains an open issue.
3 Towards Phonology Induction
Our current research efforts are directed towards the induction of phoneme inventories for languages
that lack the standard resources needed for speech model training. This task aligns with other work
in zero-resource subword modeling. Existing unsupervised methods for discovering acoustic units
derive acoustic-phonetic and latent auditory-like representations, but the typological accuracy of
these representations is uncertain.
Our initial work with "universal" multilingual phoneme recognizers was not successful. This was
mainly because the limited training data and the lack of language models to guide the search frequently
led to unreliable phoneme inventory recovery even for closely related dialects, for instance, in trying
to identify the phoneme inventory of one dialect after being exposed to two others. An improved
strategy involves incorporating language identification and phonological typology into the phoneme
recognizer. Using an accurate language identification model, the phoneme inventories of the most
closely related languages can be employed to narrow down the potential phonemic hypotheses for a
new, previously unseen language or dialect.
We are currently adapting the phonological contrast predictor methods from the previous section for
phonology induction tasks. Several approaches for detecting phonemic features in continuous speech
are known, some relying solely on signal processing and others that are model-based. At a basic
level, the output of such predictors represents speech as parallel, asynchronous streams of articulatory
features. More complex models that utilize the structure of articulation, feature geometry, and other
correlations between features are also feasible. In these methods, cross-linguistic phonological
databases are crucial for not only integrating various features into phonemes but also for validating
which combinations of hypothesized phonemes are acceptable based on known phoneme inventories.
Furthermore, additional phonological insights from other typological resources can be incorporated if
they can be reliably extracted from the speech signal.
